# Button Click Counter Project

A simple JavaScript project to practice DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Task 1 : Button Click Counter
- A simple JavaScript project that counts button clicks.
- Each click updates the count dynamically.
### What I learned
- DOM selection
- Event handling using '.onclick'

## Task 2 : Counter with Reset
- Added a reset button to set the count back to zero.
- Handled singular and plural text (time/times)
### What I learned
- Difference between 'addEventListener' and '.onclick'
- Basic state management

## Task 3 : Counter using Objects and Events
- Refactored the counter logic into a single object
- reduced repeated code by grouping state and behaviour together
### What I learned
- Using objects to mange state and behaviour
- Seperating UI events from buisness logic
- Reusing methods instead of duplicating logic
- Applying basic encapsulation in javaScript

## Task 4 : Input based counter with validation
- Added an input field to control how much the counter increases.
- Implemented proper input validation (NaN, Zero, negative values).
- Reused existing methods instead of duplicating logic.
### What I learned
- Input values are always strings and must be converted explicitly.
- why validation order matters (NaN before range checks).
